# Body Fat Prediction
Welcome to the BodyFat Prediction Project! This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating body fat percentage based on various body circumference measurements. The dataset used in this project contains measurements of 252 men, including body density, age, weight, height, and circumference measurements of different body parts. We employed machine learning techniques, including gradient boosting, to train our predictive model. The trained model is exposed via a Plumber API endpoint, allowing users to make predictions on new data. Additionally, we have provided code snippets for data preprocessing, model training, and API deployment to facilitate understanding and usage of the project. Whether you're interested in exploring the data, training your own models, or using our pre-trained model for body fat estimation, this project has something for you. Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different models, and contribute to further improvements!
